Position Title: Audio Software Engineer (Graduate/Intern)

Company Overview
Join WaveLab Innovations, a fast‑growing music‑technology startup dedicated to empowering producers, musicians, and creatives with intuitive, high‑performance audio tools. We blend cutting‑edge audio‑DSP, elegant UI/UX, and web‑native technologies to deliver seamless studio experiences—on desktop and in the browser. Based in London with a global user community, we value technical excellence, open source collaboration, and a passion for music.

Role Summary
As an Audio Software Engineer, you will design, develop, and ship new audio applications and plugins across macOS and web platforms. You’ll work end‑to‑end on features such as real‑time audio I/O, digital signal‑processing algorithms, and browser‑based deployments—leveraging your skills in C/C++, Swift, Python, and web technologies. This role is ideal for a recent (or upcoming) Computer Science graduate who’s built DSP tools, macOS apps, or in‑browser audio demos and is eager to hit “record” on their professional career.

Key Responsibilities
DSP & Plugin Development
Architect and implement real‑time audio processing algorithms (EQs, filters, effects) in C++ using the JUCE framework.
Deliver VST, AU, and AAX plugin builds with polished graphic user interfaces and live‑frequency visualizers.
macOS Audio Applications
Build and maintain native macOS apps using Swift and the Core Audio Taps API for system‑level audio capture and routing.
Ensure robust permission handling, low‑latency I/O, and a seamless user experience.
Web‑Native Audio Tools
Deploy Python‑based algorithms to the browser via Brython or WebAssembly, creating in‑browser demos and utilities.
Optimize performance, load times, and responsive UI for client‑side audio processing.
Algorithmic Research & Optimization
Investigate and benchmark advanced heuristics (e.g. SAT‑solver branching strategies) to improve tool performance.
Profile code, refine data structures (occurrence lists, caching), and document findings in GitHub‑hosted repos.
Collaboration & Open Source
Work in an agile, Git‑driven environment; write clear, maintainable code and unit tests.
Engage with our open‑source community: review PRs, author technical documentation, and contribute demos.
Required Qualifications
Education:
BSc (Hons) in Computer Science (or equivalent), graduating 2024–2025.
Technical Skills:
C++ & JUCE: Hands‑on experience building audio plugins (VST/AU) with real‑time DSP.
Swift & Core Audio: Proven ability to develop native macOS apps using the Core Audio Taps API.
Python & Web Deployment: Implemented algorithms in Python; deployed to browser via Brython or similar.
Algorithms & Data Structures: Strong understanding of shortest‑path, SAT‑solving, recursion, and efficiency heuristics.
Version Control: Proficient with Git workflows, branching, PR reviews.
Soft Skills:
Clear communication—experience managing teams or communities.
Self‑starter attitude; able to research independently and benchmark solutions.
Fluency in English (C1) and French (native); Arabic or Spanish a plus.
Preferred Experience
Contributions to open‑source audio or algorithmic projects on GitHub.
Familiarity with Node.js, Express, and front‑end frameworks (HTML/CSS/JS).
Exposure to audio production tools (Logic Pro X, Reaper) or digital music workflows.
Interest in surfing, cycling, or other creative pursuits—bringing a fresh perspective to product design.
What We Offer
Competitive salary or internship stipend, plus equity options.
Flexible hybrid work model (London office + remote).
Professional development budget for courses (e.g. CS50, conferences).
A collaborative culture centered on innovation and music—surf trips and jam sessions encouraged!
