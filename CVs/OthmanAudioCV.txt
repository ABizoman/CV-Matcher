PROJECTS 
Occurrence List DPLL Sat Solver                     
Academic Project | Python, Brython                    2025                             
-Developed a Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland style sat-solver in python from scratch (no libraries). 
-Conducted research and extensive benchmarking to implement the most time-efficient branching heuristic. 
-Implemented clause modification through an occurrence list, resulting in ~50% efficiency gains vs. efficient iterative 
methods. 
-Documented my findings on GitHub. 
-Deployed the solver as an in-browser tool with Brython, running the python solver natively in the client-side JS. 
SampleRecorder                                                             
Audio Programming | MacOS App | Swift, Core Audio Taps                 2025 
-Made a lightweight Open-Source Mac OS app for music producers and creatives to be able to record system audio without 
having to re-route through an Aggregate Device manually. 
-Used MacOS’s new Core Audio Taps API to do so. 
-Learned about the low-level Mac OS audio architecture to create a robust audio system, complete with system permission 
checking. 
Graphic 3-Band EQ 
Audio Programming | C++ | JUCE framework          2024-2025 
-Developed a graphic EQ deployed as AU, VST and VST3 for personal use using the JUCE framework. 
-Made a graphic UI complete with a graph showing the live frequencies of the audio being played
